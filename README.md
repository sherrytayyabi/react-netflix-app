This project signifies the development of a front-end Netflix clone using React.js, integrated with a Firebase back-end. Using the TMDB (The Movie Database) API for data retrieval, and implementing Firebase Authentication for secure login functionality, this application ensures a dynamic and engaging user experience. Offering users the capability to store and manage specific data, the project combines the efficiency of React.js for the front-end and the reliability of Firebase for the back-end infrastructure. The front-end design is built using Tailwind CSS.
